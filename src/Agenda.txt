Steps for Basic Setup of Typescript application
    npm init
    typescript as a dependecy 
    Types 
    tsconfig.json => Specifying the configuration for typescript compiler

Typescript Decorators
    Extension over the features the class is fulfilling
        Logging on to Method/Parameter/Property
        Styling
        Formatting (Date Time Formatter)
        Validation

    Parts of Class
    Extending Class fields => Property Decorator
    Constuctor => Class Decorator
    Methods => Method Decorator
        Method Paramters => Parameter Decorator
    
    No instance creation done via Decorator
    No Asynchronous Logic is being added 

    USP : 
    Decorators for reusability.

    Examples:
        Minimum pass Validation
        Login Validators
        Date Time Formatter
        Trim type Formatter


    Method Decorator
    Class Decorator
    Parameter Decorator
    Property Decorator

    Reusability of features in the code base 

Typescript Generics: 
        Using Generics expect T type functions, 
    Method Generics
        Any is Data type T is type of Generic, T is standard that we should follow
    Class Generics
        Grid => as UI Component (UI model)
            2 different routes => 
            Generic Classes for Row and Column 
                Row => id => T <number, string> => Data Models Definition should be generic based
